        <h3>How will my data be shared?</h3>
        <p>The Measurement Lab (M-Lab) platform is run by the scientific community. We make all test results publicly available via the MeasurementLab.net
          website to help promote Internet research. M-Lab's Network Diagnostic Tool collects a number of measures of different facets of your Internet
          connection. The information published includes each device’s IP address, but does not include personal identifying information about you as an
          Internet user.</p>

        <h3>How will my information be secured?</h3>
        <p>The Quello Center and Merit Network will be responsible for data management related to this project. Data will be maintained and archived in a secure
          and password-protected repository at servers at Michigan State University. Data and metadata will be provided in accordance with the Data
          Documentation Initiative (DDI) standard for the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. All data will be made available in a format that protects
          anonymity and confidentiality.</p>

        <h3>How does the Broadband Speed Test work?</h3>
        <p>The Michigan Broadband Speed Test utilizes the open source test and servers provided by Measurement Lab (M-Lab), a consortium of public interest
          groups, academic institutions and industry partners, providing an open platform dedicated to Internet performance measurement. When you start a test,
          your browser opens a connection to the closest M-Lab server. It then exchanges with the server a synthetic stream of data, generated solely for the
          purpose of measuring your connection at that time. During the test, the server collects around 100 low-level metrics. When the test is completed, the
          user is shown three of the most accessible measurements: download speed, upload speed, and minimum round trip time.</p>

        <h3>Why does this test show different results than other tests like speedtest.net?</h3>
        <p>Different network measurement tests sometimes show variance in results due to factors such as the methodology of the test. Both <a
            href="https://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a> and M-Lab's tests are valid measurements but have different methods and instrumentation which account
          for the difference in measurements.</p>
        <p>In both M-Lab's NDT test and Ookla's <a href="https://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a> test, there is a client and a server component. The client is
          the test running in your browser in both cases. Ookla's servers are always within the ISP's last mile network, while M-Lab's servers are always in
          transit data centers, outside of any ISP last mile network. The FCC (and their measurement consultant SamKnows) refer to this difference as "on-net"
          and "off-net" measurement. You can learn more about this difference at this link: <a
            href="http://samknows.com/infrastructure">http://samknows.com/infrastructure.</a></p>
        <p>The <a href="https://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a> test is an on-net measurement of your connection's performance to the edge of your ISP's
          network, and M-Lab's test is an off-net measurement of your connection's performance through your ISP's network to one of M-Lab's servers in a Seattle
          Internet exchange point. M-Lab's methodology is based on the rationale that consumers request content from the Internet which could be anywhere in the
          world, most of which is outside their ISP's network. By tracing the performance over the full path of the your broadband connection to the global
          Internet, M-Lab measures the performance of your connection across interconnected networks, which is closer to the way you access the Internet
          everyday.</p>

        <h3>Why does this test show different results than other tests like speedtest.net?</h3>
        <p>Internet performance tests may provide different results for a lot of reasons. Three of the main reasons for different results among tests are listed
          below:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Differences in the location of testing servers</p>
            <p>Every performance test has two parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Client</strong>: This is the software that runs on the user’s machine and shows the user their speed results.</li>
              <li><strong>Server</strong>: This is the computer on the Internet to which the client connects to complete the test.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              A test generates data between the client and the server, and measures performance between these two points. The location of these two points is
              important in terms of understanding the results of a given test.
              If the server is located within your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) own network (also known as the “last mile”), this is referred to as an
              <em>“on-net”</em> measurement. This approach lets you know about how your Internet connection is performing intra-network within your ISP, but it
              does not necessarily reflect the full experience of using the Internet, which almost always involves using inter-network connections (connections
              between networks) to access content and services that are hosted somewhere outside of your ISP. Results from on-net testing are often higher than
              those achieved by using other methods, since the “distance” traveled is generally shorter, and the network is entirely controlled by one provider
              (your ISP).
              <em>“Off-net”</em> measurements occur between your computer and a server located outside of your ISP’s network. This means that traffic crosses
              inter-network borders and often travels longer distances. Off-net testing frequently produces results that are lower than those produced from
              on-net testing.
              M-Lab’s measurements are always conducted off-net. This way, M-Lab is able to measure performance from testers’ computers to locations where
              popular Internet content is often hosted. By having inter-network connections included in the test, test users get a real sense of the performance
              they could expect when using the Internet.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Differences in testing methods</p>
            <p> Different Internet performance tests measure different things in different ways. M-Lab’s NDT test tries to transfer as much data as it can in
              ten seconds (both up and down), using a single connection to an M-Lab server. Other popular tests try to transfer as much data as possible at once
              across multiple connections to their server. Neither method is “right” or “wrong,” but using a single stream is more likely to help diagnose
              problems in the network than multiple streams would. Learn more about M-Lab’s NDT methodology. All NDT data collected by M-Lab are publicly
              available in both visualized (graphic), queryable, and raw (unanalyzed) forms.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Changing network conditions and distinct test paths</p>
            <p>The Internet is always changing, and test results reflect that. A test conducted five minutes ago may show very different results from a test
              conducted twenty minutes ago. This can be caused by the test traffic being routed differently. For example, one test might travel over a path with
              broken router, while another may not. A test run today may be directed to a test server located farther away than a test run yesterday.
              Additionally, IPv4 and IPv6 routes may take different physical paths. Some IPv6 routes may be tunneled through IPv4, from the client, or at any
              point after the client depending on local network management. In short, running one test will give you a sense of network conditions at that
              moment, across the best network path available at that time, to the specific server coordinating the test. But because Internet routing and
              infrastructure change dynamically, testing regularly and looking at the data over time are much more reliable ways to gauge representative
              performance.</p>
        </ol>


        <h3>Data We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          We collect data from several public and non-public sources in order to perform this service.
          Data that is not considered public data includes individualized survey responses and an
          associated broadband speed measurement test. Survey responses can include local addresses
          and property parcel IDs along with user-generated responses to how a household manages and
          uses any Internet service. Data is not specifically tied to an individual but a home,
          property, or residence within a geographical area.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Do With Data</h3>
        <p>
          Public and provided data is aggregated and analyzed to report on broadband availability
          within census block units of a geographic area. Graphs, maps, and tabular reports are
          generated to display census-level blocks corresponding with adoption of Internet Service
          Providers (ISPs), average broadband usage, and other aggregated data resulting from
          user-driven surveys.
        </p>

        <p>
          Broadband speed testing data is gathered via the Measurement Lab (M-Lab) platform,
          and is run by the scientific community. All test results are publicly available via
          the <a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/">MeasurementLab.net</a> website to help promote Internet research,
          as M-Lab's Network Diagnostic Tool collects a number of measures of different
          facets of Internet connections. The information published includes each device’s
          IP address, but does not include personal identifying information about specific
          Internet users.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
        <p>
          Collected data is stored in a third-party platform (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">Google BigQuery</a>)
          for research and analysis, with aggregate reporting data compiled and stored on secured systems at Merit Network.
          Data is kept encrypted at rest and in transit where technically possible and kept within the United States.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aggregate and report data is provided to the project's sponsor as a deliverable of this
          service. Data may be retained indefinitely by Merit Network in order to assist with
          longitudinal studies with the express purpose of assisting municipalities, governments,
          and other organizations with increasing broadband deployment and usage within the
          United States.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>
          All data collected and created is treated with the same level of data classification
          as Merit's own internal data, and subsequently with the same level of protections and
          security controls as well. Data may only be viewed by individuals performing work on
          the data, and access is restricted to the minimum amount of access necessary to
          perform work. Oversight of privacy and security controls surrounding this data is
          performed by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at Merit Network.
        </p>

        <h3>What do these results mean?</h3>
        <p>
          Your speed test results show the actual upload and download speeds you are experiencing at the time you take the test. Results can vary due to the
          device you are using, your operating system, the browser you use, the time of day you take the test, whether you are using WiFi or a wired connection,
          the number of devices connected to the same signal at once, and many other factors. You can take this test as many times as you like, from as many
          devices and locations as you like. If the speeds you are receiving do not match up to your expectations, you have a number of options.

                    Internet infrastructure and citizens’ use of it is
                    ever-evolving. A test conducted today may show different
                    results than a test conducted last week. This can be caused

                    over time.
                  </p>

                  <p>Two things to ensure the most accurate test results:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Minimizing the "noise" during an internet speed test, which is what the several tips above help you do, certainly contributes to a more
                      accurate speed test result.</li>
                    <li>Testing and retesting typically provide the best results</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
                    If you are seeing results that differ from other speed tests, the MLab <a
                      href="https://www.merit.edu/services/moonshot/rural-broadband-faqs/">FAQ</a> provides helpful information to help understand why.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Results are an accumlation of all MLab tests. Any test taken with an
                    MLab testing application (i.e. the speed test within Google search
                    resutls) will be presented in these results.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The results displayed are aggregated every 24 hours. Therefore, new survey data will not be immediately available.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For the most accurate test results:
                    If possible, connect to the Internet directly via a cable, DSL, or fiber modem

                          Internet infrastructure and citizens’ use of it is
                          ever-evolving. A test conducted today may show different
                          results than a test conducted last week. This can be caused
                          by changes in equipment, the number of people using the
                          network simultaneously and the services people use on the
                          Internet. We encourage participants to take the speed test
